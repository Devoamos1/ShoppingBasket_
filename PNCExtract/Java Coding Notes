Concept /Task

Loop through files LD001.1 LD001.2 LD001.3 hence bufferedreader[]
Create count total and output that total to a text file hence BufferedWriter writer

Java buffer - It is a region of a physical memory storage used to temporarily store data 
while it is being moved from one place to another.

Implement class using  
- public class DevontesCounter implements Counter {

1. Using regular expression defines a search pattern for strings.

Read all ASCII extended list and output all characters not used.



Java notes

FileInputstream - A FileInputStream obtains input bytes from a file in a file system. What files are available depends on the host environment.

Data inputstream - The DataInputStream works with the binary data, while the BufferedReader work with character data

Buffered reader
.replaceall changes a substring of text in a line to a new string 

InputStream - is that InputStream reads as byte - Both work with normal text But if the text is a你们, which is composed of an a and two Chinese characters, then the  InputStream does not work.
InputStreamReader -  while InputStreamReader reads as char.
